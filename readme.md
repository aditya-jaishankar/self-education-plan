# Aritifical Intelligence with a Machine Learning Focus
This repository collects all resoures and material that I am using towards learning Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. The materials are divided into two sections: **Resources**, and **My Codes and Solutions**.  

## Resources
None of this material is mine. I have collected them from various sources on Github and elsewhere. Many thanks to [josephmisiti](https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning), [jhermann](https://github.com/jhermann/awesome-python-talks), [kirang89](https://github.com/kirang89/pycrumbs), [ujjwalkarn](https://github.com/ujjwalkarn/Machine-Learning-Tutorials), [s16h](https://github.com/s16h/py-must-watch), [datasciencemasters](https://github.com/datasciencemasters/go), and [hangtwenty](https://github.com/hangtwenty/dive-into-machine-learning). Much of my thinking and plans have been shaped by their awesome lists of resources.

**Papers to reproduce**

Reproducing papers is a great way to level-up machine learning skills. Find a good listing of seminal ML and AI papers. Pick papers to reproduce - perhaps with a science-based application focus (Navier-Stokes equations, materials design, chemical synthesis, etc.?)

The next two papers are both prediciting chaotic turbulent flow using an ML approach:
* [Using Machine Learning to Replicate Chaotic Attractors and Calculate Lyapunov Exponents from Data.]
* [Model-Free Prediction of Large Spatiotemporally Chaotic Systems from Data: A Reservoir Computing Approach]
* [Top 20 most cited papers since 2014 - KDNugets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/04/top-20-papers-machine-learning.html) - Pick a few based on interest and recreate from scratch.
